      "review": "These were a good set of action movies from Chris. I feel like every male actor has this phase where they want to do a action/ big pew pew movie. First Extraction, good setup, story decent. Even left some crumbs for the next movie. He did well as a action guy. There were some nice cinematography shots in both as well. Camera work nice and experimental-ish."

      "review": "This movie was actually really solid. Couldnt ask for more. Maybe Megatrons reasoning could have been a little more fleshed out, but as it is, it was good. The comedy was solid. Animation was solid. Each of D-16 and Orion Pax' transformations into what we know them as today was so good. The voice actors were good too. Scarlets was maybe to noticable for me, but the maturing voices of Mega and Optimus as they went through thier 3 transformations was a good touch. Would rewatch."

      "review": "Enojoyed the period-ish piece. Kinda goofy. Tatum is just rockin them turtle neck sweaters its good. Story idea alright, plays into the conpiracy aspect of it all. Honelty Tataum is lo-key goated might be in contention for the ryan gosling / ryan reynolds spot."

      "rating": 0.5,
      "review": "The movie was actually bad. Like even a main premiss of the story just flops mainly because there just isnt any substance to the story. Would have been way better if they only focused on Gru deciding to live a family life or a villain life. But he doesnt have any character conflict at all."
